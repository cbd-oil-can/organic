			<p> Recently, Japanese-style gardens have become very popular around the world. Even serious botanical gardens try to have expositions on this subject or at least corners with this subject. In these gardens, we are attracted to the laconicism and special harmony of the elements of nature.
<br> <br>
An indisputable feature of Japanese-style gardens is the deepest symbolism of simplicity, laconicism, and at the same time, the unobtrusiveness of its structural elements, which act as a kind of prism, through the plane of which the very versatility of nature is visible.
<br> <br>
If you decide to make a Japanese garden on your site or a corner stylized as a Japanese garden, you need to think over and draw a draft of the Japanese garden. After all, you need to consider all the features and symbols, since everything should be harmonious in the Japanese garden, it does not tolerate random things.
<br> <br>
To understand the features of such gardens, let’s take a look at the history of the development of Japanese gardens. </p> <br> <br>
<h1> Gardens of Japan - A History of Development </h1> <br> <br>
<p> The gardens of Japan have an ancient history that goes back more than a thousand years. The oldest manual in the world on the arrangement of gardens "Sakuteiki", written presumably in the second half of the XI century, tells about the art of landscape design in Japan.
<br> <br>
There are several periods in the development of Japanese gardens:
<br> <br>
The Nara period (VI-VIII centuries) is characterized by the influence of Chinese culture. Symbolism appeared, various plants, water constructions were used. The location of the garden next to the imperial palace is a characteristic feature of this period. Each element of the garden carried a semantic load. The so-called temple and palace gardens are being created.
<br> <br>
Heian period (IX - XII centuries). During this period, the capital of Kyoto appears, with it the culture of creating gardens began to flourish and became an integral part of the life of representatives of high society. The creation of the gardens of Japan of this period is the prerogative of aristocrats and educated people. During this period, the first gardens of the tea ceremony appeared, with which the design of the gardens was directly connected, so it was carried out in a special pavilion, the path to which lay through the garden.
<br> <br>
Muromachi period (XV century). A characteristic feature of the creation of gardens of this period is the presence of free space so that the visitor himself could finish painting in his imagination. Pretty simple compositions with a small amount of expressive and informative elements are used.
<br> <br>
The Moribana period (late XIX - early XX centuries). At this stage, adaptation to the conditions of the European interior takes place and the influence of Western civilization is reflected. A special element in the Japanese garden are flat floor vases.
<br> <br>
The art of creating a garden of Japan is developing rapidly in our days. Refined traditional style is based on the accumulated experience and the developed techniques of creating gardens and caring for them. Acquired skills are passed on from generation to generation. Based on more than a thousand years of experience in garden art, the Japanese divide the gardens according to functional characteristics into several groups: temple, palace, tea ceremony gardens.

<p> Creating a harmonious balance of the elements of the Japanese garden is the main compositional principle, in which there is order and freedom, movement and peace. At the same time, the color scheme of the Japanese garden is quite restrained. Of the bright colors, shades of red are most often used.
<br> <br>
The Japanese landscape is based on a natural landscape consisting of five components, one spiritual and four material: an idea, a stone, water, a plant and architectural elements. Moreover, the main elements are always water and stone. There may not even be plants in the Japanese garden, but water and stone are required to be present.
<br> <br>
Each natural element of the Japanese garden, endowed with a semantic load, has a deep meaning and is able to cause the visitor a sense of harmony, both internal and external. Water is an irreplaceable source, a symbol of life on Earth. And garden life in particular. A seething brook, a hectic river, protected by stone banks, rapidly turning into a lush waterfall. Or a calm, quiet pond with islands. How smoothly water flows, the days of our life flow smoothly: sometimes it is measured and beyond, sometimes overcoming obstacles and struggling with the strength of the stream. The contemplation and sound of a bubbling, continuous stream of water reminds us of how fast the time is. The bridge crossing the reservoir symbolizes the journey, the transition from one world to another.
<br> <br>
An important place in the Japanese garden is also given to decorative elements, because all of them together and individually carry invisible light and fill the space with healing energy for the soul. A traditional component of the Japanese garden is tsukubai, which is a stone bowl with water in the form of a flat barrel, in which hands were traditionally washed during a tea ceremony. The height of the structure is from 20 cm to 50-60 cm, although in some cases the Tsukubai can be at ground level. The usual location is a small low and flat area in the center of the garden or in front of a stone wall, hedge. Near it is often placed another undoubted decoration for the Japanese garden - a stone lantern. As a rule, lanterns are located at the turn of the path, near the bridge, on the edge of a reservoir or stream, in front of a tree. This element can be the main one in a group with small stones. This is a very beautiful decorative element of the garden. In the stylized Japanese gardens of the Magic Garden company, such lanterns are used even for purely decorative purposes, lighting a regular wax candle inside the lantern. The lantern protects the candle from the wind, and the garden is filled with the life of a living fire.
<br> <br>
The most changeable component of the garden are plants, symbolizing the natural inconstancy, variability of life. Pine in Japan is a symbol of longevity, courage, masculinity, strong character, plum is often used from flowering trees, rhododendron is used from shrubs, and maples belong to the unconditional primacy among deciduous trees, among which palm leaves are most respected. And of course, one of the main plants is sakura. Interestingly, the Japanese consider 11 species of plants as sakura. Their main feature is stone fruit plants, blooming in spring, mostly pink.
<br> <br>
A diverse assortment of plants is used: dwarf pine, juniper, cypress, spruce, evergreen and deciduous rhododendrons, boxwoods, maples. Of perennial herbaceous plants - ferns, hosts, irises, chrysanthemums. </p>

		<h1> Rock Garden </h1> <br> <br>
<p> Gardens of stones serve as a place for meditation, a nook of calm and tranquility, detachment from everyday problems and worries, a place where you can find peace of mind and just relax your body and soul.
<br> <br>
The tradition of decorating the Japanese rock garden is strictly subordinate to the norms of Zen Buddhism, emphasizing the Japanese love for nature, philosophical thoughts, solitude.
<br> <br>
The most famous example is the rock garden in Ryoanji, a temple in Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan, attracting thousands of garden art connoisseurs every year from all over the world.
<br> <br>
The Japanese rock garden is a small rectangular area, strewn with white coarse gravel. It is located along the garden and is part of the temple complex, in connection with which visitors are given the opportunity to receive a portion of aesthetic pleasure only from the veranda of the temple. The composition of the garden consists of five groups of black unprocessed stones in the amount of fifteen, "framed" with green moss. The atmosphere of the sea coast is created by a sandy surface “combed” onto parallel grooves. A sense of security and comfort provides an adobe fence that, like a wall, separates the three sides of the garden from the outside world, the world of fuss and disharmony. But, from which side of the veranda you would not stand, no matter how hard you peered, you would not be able to see the fifteenth stone. Although, sometimes it even creates a deceptive impression that all fifteen stones are visible. Unfortunately, this is just an optical illusion. The irregular shape of the stones helps to achieve this effect, because of which each of them is perceived as a full two. There is a chance to see the famous fifteenth stone in the garden. Only he who achieves "enlightenment" can see him. </p> <br> <br>
