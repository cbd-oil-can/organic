			<h1> DIY artificial pond </h1> <br> <br>

<p> In order to decorate your garden plot and make it even more comfortable, it is worth equipping it with an artificial pond. An artificial pond will give your garden plot uniqueness and sophistication, emphasize the taste of the owner and maintain a suitable microclimate, which will positively affect both your health and the health of plants in your garden. Watching the pouring water in the fresh air not only relaxes and cheers you up, but also pacifies and energizes any person. </p> <br> <br>
<h1> Artificial pond and decorative pond - Planning </h1> <br> <br>
<p> Creating a decorative pond with your own hands is not such an impossible task as it might seem at first glance. A guarantee of high-quality performance of work and satisfaction of all your wishes, of course, will be an appeal to professionals for help. But let's say that you want to make an artificial pond with your own hands. Before grabbing a shovel and digging a pit for a future pond or ordering a fountain, you should carefully consider the type, shape, location of the water body and, most importantly, the possible difficulties in translating your plan into reality. For example, you want to see a natural body of water on your site. There is enough space for it, earthwork is also not a problem for you, but what to do with the excavated soil? The amount of land that will soon replace water can be used to create an embankment along the contour of this or another reservoir or for a rock garden, for example. Think about whether the project will not be unsafe for your children (or for the children of your friends, because they will also want to look at the masterpiece created by your hands) and whether its implementation will lead to problems with neighbors. But even if, according to your estimates, the construction of a decorative reservoir in a personal plot does not cause you any problems or complications, but only moral satisfaction from the result of the work, then do not forget that the project should fit well into the general appearance and style of your site.
<br> <br>
The dimensions of an artificial pond can start from a plastic bucket or a wooden tub. The upper limit is not indicated - it all depends on the size of your site and its total load with other elements. As elsewhere, it is best to be guided by the principle of the "golden mean." For example, in a territory from 10 to 15 hundred parts, a reservoir with a water mirror area of ​​4-5 square meters will be quite enough. m. The choice of location is also extremely important. The pond should be warmed up by the sun at least 6 hours a day; accordingly, it is extremely undesirable to arrange it in the shade of trees or any structure. In this case, it is generally worthwhile to stay away from trees, since fallen leaves or fruits can lead to decay of water and an unpleasant smell that is natural in this case.
<br> <br>
Measure the size of the site, decide how much territory and where you will allocate for an artificial pond, and try to draw a sketch. Regardless of how high quality you can display your desires on paper, the sketch of the project will simplify the life of you or the specialists hired by you to a greater or lesser extent when implementing it.
<br> <br>
Artificial reservoirs in general can be divided into two groups: formal and informal. Formal ponds - ponds with sides intersecting at right angles, tiled with tiles, brick or stone. Informal or decorative reservoirs - reservoirs that look as close as possible to natural ones. Any artificial reservoir can be built either using a stamped rigid form, or using a plastic flexible waterproofing coating. If the decorative pond will be above ground level, then it is more convenient and wise to use the first option - hard type waterproofing.
<br> <br>
If your garden is not large enough to accommodate a full-fledged decorative reservoir in it, you can limit yourself to small forms of water. An artificial pond or pond can be created in containers of almost any size - in a trough, canister and even a plastic bottle. The main condition is that the walls of the container should be thick enough to maintain a constant temperature of the water in the container. And, of course, for your own safety, you should not use lead tanks.
<br> <br>
Now that you have decided on the type, size and location of the reservoir, you can begin to create it. But we consider it necessary to warn you that to create a truly beautiful and original reservoir without unnecessary physical effort and the loss of a decent number of nerve cells, you should contact our professionals who, following your order and taking into account all your wishes, will realize your dream with adequate financial costs on your part.
 </p>
<h1> DIY pond </h1> <br> <br>
<p> The first step to building a pond with your own hands is the choice of tools and materials. Reasonably selected tools will help you to complete the task faster and better, and the right materials will help create the decorative pond of your dreams. Do not skimp, choose the best quality available to you within your means, but do not forget that purchasing in bulk is cheaper after all (a good test of your planning skills). Undoubtedly, if you decide to get by with just a shovel, this will to some extent reduce costs, but it is unlikely to positively affect the quality and speed of work. And saving on materials, or rather on their quality, will only lead to expensive repairs, for example, cracks in the bottom and walls of a reservoir. Do not forget that a do-it-yourself pond requires adequate planning of the costs of materials and tools without compromising the quality of the project. Also, it is not recommended to reduce the cost of skilled labor, especially if the project is quite complicated, because making a really chic pond with your own hands is unlikely that you will have enough energy, time and, most importantly, knowledge. Of course, no one can forbid you to try, but we recommend hiring qualified specialists for any complex work that requires expert knowledge, in particular, when constructing a decorative reservoir. In this case, the staff of qualified employees of our company is at your service. </p> <br> <br>
<h1> Pond Construction - Tools </h1> <br> <br>
<p> Tools for creating an artificial pond can be divided into several groups:

• Tools for carrying weights: gloves, bucket, wheelbarrow.

In order to, with a minimum of effort, carry or lift something, use a wheelbarrow and buckets. A wheelbarrow with large wheels and the presence of a tread will help you to easily deliver materials to the desired point if you have to climb the slope of the pond along the way. Well, if the car has a guard rail in front of the wheel - with its help the process of tipping and unloading the car is greatly simplified. Work shoes, clothing and gloves should be strong enough. Even if your movements, for example, with gloves on, are a little cramped and this causes some inconvenience, think about calluses and wounds that will certainly appear if you remove them. It’s good to have two pairs of gloves - leather for general work and rubber for work related to water.

• Tools for measuring and marking: tape measure, alcohol level, pegs, twine, chalk.

Pond construction is a complex and painstaking process that requires careful planning and meticulous measurements. For measurements, it is preferable to use a tape measure with a fiberglass measuring tape - unlike metal, it is not exposed to water.

Use twine and wooden pegs to mark the boundaries of a future artificial reservoir, for example, for a natural pond of irregular shape. Use chalk when marking materials that do not require high precision processing. Alcohol level check the verticality and horizontalness of materials and construction sites.

• Tools for preparing a site for an artificial pond: bayonet, shovel, pitchfork, sledgehammer, garden scoop, garden rake and lawn rake.

The bayonet and shovel are used to remove turf and digging the ground. Sledgehammer - to compact and level the site for the future facility. Forks are used to move large clods of land. Garden rake - for leveling the ground and pebbles, rake for the lawn - for sand. A garden scoop is used similarly to a bayonet and shovel, only, respectively, for smaller pits. Also, a shovel is applicable for loading / unloading and mixing bulk materials.
•      Tools for laying the walls of the future decorative pond: a mason's hammer (brick hammer), a sledgehammer, a chisel.

You will need a sledgehammer and a chisel when you have to crack solid materials - to break off part of a stone or slab, for example, or to remove hardened mortar. They will also be needed to make holes in the masonry. The mason's hammer is highly functional. They can both hammer in pegs, how to make holes, and use for its intended purpose.

• Tools for processing metal, wood and plastic: saw, scissors, penknife, jigsaw, metal scissors, pipe cutter.

Metal - metal shears are used for cutting metal mesh or sheets of metal and for hard plastics. For cutting water pipes you have to purchase a pipe cutter.

Wood - in most cases, an ordinary saw will be enough for you, which can be used both for cutting railway sleepers and for cutting a branch. However, when performing some work (for example, in the manufacture of a Japanese scarecrow), you will need a jigsaw, and preferably an electric one.

Plastic and film for the pond - the bulk of the work with plastic and film for the pond is performed with ordinary scissors or a knife, but sometimes it is more convenient to use a saw, for example, for cutting pipes or flexible hoses for water drainage.

• Tools for working with concrete and mortar: trowel, embroidery, ironer.

When working with a mortar, a trowel is used to fill vertical joints and remove excess. Stitching will be needed for marking works, for example, for drawing lines along which bricks will be laid and other delicate works. Due to the lack of strength, it is not worth buying plastic trowels and seams.

To create a flat concrete surface you will need a smoothing machine made of any material - steel, wood or plastic. After use, the ironer should be washed well.

• Other equally important tools: drill and drill bits, adjustable wrench, screwdrivers, hammer with a nail puller.

An electric drill is useful in the frequently encountered form of work in any artificial reservoir project - for drilling holes. Screwdrivers and a wrench will be needed when tightening screws and bolts, which are also quite common in work. Well, of course, the hammer of the real owner should always be at hand - it has a very wide range of applications.
 </p> <br> <br>
 <h1> Reservoir Construction - Materials </h1> <br> <br>
 <p> Also an important aspect of the successful construction of the reservoir is the right materials. In the building materials store, you can buy sand and cement, from the supplier of special materials - concrete slabs and pebbles. Plants can be found in the horticultural center, and fountains, plastic sheets and pumps are available in a wide range from a garden specialist.

Materials for the construction of ponds, like tools, can be divided into several groups:

• Pipes, water collectors, waterproofing and linings.
Gardening pipes are used to protect wires and supply water. They come in two types - reinforced and flexible. In order that the huge stream of water, for example, when designing a water cascade, does not damage the pipe, ribbed reinforced hoses of large diameter are used. Flexible pipes are used to protect electrical cables and connect the pump. When working with this type of pipe, you need to remember that there should not be excesses - this can damage the wire and weaken or completely interrupt the flow of water.

A catchment basin is a container with a volume of a bucket, fully or almost completely recessed under the surface of the earth. Water collectors are used during the operation of the pump to maintain the required water level - the pump, being in the water collector, pumps out water, which later returns to it through the channels. This design will work perfectly if there is a factor of flowing water in your decorative pond, but do not complicate it, for example, an artificial pond. In this case, you can choose a plastic water collector with a drainage system and a lid, or (genius in simplicity!) Generally limit yourself to a bucket without a handle, dug into the ground and covered with a sheet of plastic with slots through which water will flow back .
<br><br>
Waterproofing during the construction of a reservoir - the calculation of the amount of waterproofing is simple: to the depth of the reservoir multiplied by 3, add its length and width. For example, if a pond is 2 meters deep, 3 meters long and 1 meter wide, then the dimensions of the material that you will need to waterproof an artificial reservoir: 2 * 3 + 1 = 7 meters wide and 2 * 3 + 3 = 9 meters in length. But the surest way to not make mistakes in the calculations, as always, is striking in its straightforwardness - measure your decorative pond with a tape measure, starting from the surface of the earth, going along the bottom and returning to the surface again. To the result that you get, add a few centimeters, which are necessary in those places where the film for the pond will be applied at the joints.

Lining - waterproofing lining is made of one of the films for the pond: plastic wrap, polyvinyl chloride film or butyl rubber. The question of choosing between them is solved simply because it rests solely on the life of the material: a thin film for a pond made of polyvinyl chloride will serve you for about 5 years, and butyl rubber with a more solid thickness - at least 25 years. But, no matter what material the lining is, it should be laid on a polyester coating or at least on fiberglass sheets of thermal insulation or sand.
<br><br>
• Copper pipes and sheets, connectors and pipe joints.
<br><br>
Copper pipes and sheets - when building metal structures within your artificial reservoir, it is best to use copper. It is easiest to work with it - copper is easily amenable to external processing, bends well and eventually forms a patina on its surface under the influence of air. For the design of decorative ponds, for example, hard copper pipes with a diameter of 15 mm complete with brackets for fastening pipes on straight sections and turns at an angle close to 90 degrees, and flexible copper pipes with a diameter of 10 mm for connecting water to hard-to-reach places are perfect. Also, most likely, when working you need a copper sheet. In order for the copper to become soft, it must be heated with a blowtorch to a cherry-red color and immersed in cold water.
<br><br>
Connectors and articulation units are nails, self-tapping screws, screws and hose clamps. Artificial ponds cannot be created without using these small but very important things. The simplest way to connect two copper pipes to each other is to use an articulation unit. To do this, you will have to cut the pipes to the desired length, insert their ends into the joint assembly and squeeze it with a wrench without undue effort.
<br><br>
• Sand, lime and cement, stone, tile for paths and bricks.
Sand - sand is of two types: soft (building) and hard (coarse). If the former is used for finely textured mortar, the latter is for concrete and grout. Sand usually has the structure and color of the corresponding stone.
<br><br>
Lime is a material that is also used to prepare mortar. The solution can be prepared without it, but then it comes out too aggressive and, as a result, etches and stains the stone, although it turns out to be harder and able to withstand heavy loads. Lime is best acquired in small quantities and stored in places protected from moisture and inaccessible to your children and pets, because lime is a substance that can harm your health. When working with lime, use a respirator, gloves and safety glasses. If lime does get on your skin, immediately wash this area under running water.
<br><br>
Cement - cement, like lime, is hygroscopic and harmful to your health, therefore the same precautions should be observed when storing and using it.
<br><br>
Stone - when creating an artificial pond, you will most likely use stones such as slate, silicon, limestone, pebbles and gravel. Slate and sandstone come in handy for decorative coatings. For the image of boulders and rough blocks, limestone is excellent. And gravel and cobblestone are good material if you need to cover a large area with stones.
<br><br>
Tile for paths and bricks - building bricks find their application, for example, when framing water collectors. The tile can be of any shape, color and texture, the main thing is that it fits the rest of the decoration of the decorative reservoir.
<br><br>
• wood
<br><br>
In some cases, railroad ties are used when decorating garden plots and, in particular, when creating artificial ponds with their own hands. But most often, logs and roughly processed pine boards are used. For example, logs of the same length, placed on a wire stretched through them, will serve as an excellent mini-fence next to a decorative pond. A worthy application can also be thought up for pine boards, which are easiest to purchase in a garden center. </p>
